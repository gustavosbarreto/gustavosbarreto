# About Me

I have over 15 years of experience as a software engineer in a company
with a focus on Linux and related open-source technologies so I have
worked with many programming languages and technologies from
low-level to domain-specific ones, such as C/C++, Golang, Node.js,
Ruby, Python and Groovy from Jenkins CI.

I'm passionate about clean code, coding standards, design patterns and
software design principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY).

I have strong Linux architecture knowledge which was acquired while
working with Embedded Linux customization so I'm good to debugging,
reverse engineering, investigating and solving problems regardless of
the underlying software stack.
